# Democratic Diplomacy
**This variant allows an unlimited number of players to play, until the end. Everyone wins.**

Citizens live in countries, and are using a voting system to choose the next set of orders. As their home supply center gets overtaken by another country, they simply become citizens of that country and keep playing. 

Because the game is based on voting, this variant allows any number of citizens to play and even allow citizens to be absent from the game over a period of time.


## Setup
### Setup - Rule 1
Each citizen is assigned to a supply center within a country.
Since there may be an uneven number of citizens for the supply centers, the process for
assignment is as follows:
1. Randomize the list of supply centers.
2. Randomize the list of citizens.
3. Assign each citizen to a supply center using round robin.

### Setup - Rule 2
Add each citizen to their country's mailing list or chat room.
A citizen within the country is entitled to communicate with other citizens within the country in
order to contribute to the gameplay.


## Gameplay
### Diplomatic Phase - Rule 1
A diplomat that represents their country should be selected to communicate with other
countries.
Any citizen may post to their nomination and any supporting commentary to the countries
mailing list or chat room.
Any citizen may vote for nominees. See the section on voting.
Any citizen may change their voting preferences. The changes may cause the selected diplomat
to change at the beginning of each Diplomatic Phase.
The name of the selected diplomat is visible to all countries.

### Diplomatic Phase - Rule 2
The selected diplomat of each country communicates with other selected diplomats. Updates
are posted in the countries mailing list or chatroom for the citizens.

### Diplomatic Phase - Rule 3
Any citizen within a country may propose to their country:
1. A unique set orders that they believe should be submitted on behalf of the country.
2. Commentary to gain support from other citizens.
3. Commentary on other orders to rebut or request clarification.

### Order Writing Phase - Rule 1
Any citizen may preferentially vote for sets of orders. See the section on voting.

### Order Writing Phase - Rule 2
The winning set of orders is submitted.

### Retreat and Disbanding Phase - Rule 1
Retreat orders are proposed, voted upon and submitted in the same way as the movement
phases.

### Gaining and Losing Units Phase - Rule 1
Once a country gains control of a supply center, the citizens of that supply center are
immediately transferred to the new country prior to disbanding or building units.
### Gaining and Losing Units Phase - Rule 2
Disbanding and building orders are proposed, voted upon and submitted in the same way as the
movement phases.

## Voting
### General voting rules
1. Voting is based on the [Single Transferable Vote System using an elimination transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#Simplest_method:_elimination_transfers_only). The winning option is chosen once 50% of the votes are achieved.
  - Citizens are presented with all the available options,
  - Citizens rank their options with 1 being their preference choice, 2 for the next alternative, and so on.
  - It is not required that all the options be ranked.
2. Votes are kept secret.
3. Votes can be changed anytime prior to the voting deadline.
4. Citizens can abstain.
5. Vote counts are kept secret until the voting deadline.

### Tie Breakers
In the event that two or more options equally reach the 50% quota at a particular stage of transferring votes, trace backwards in the stages. The option that had the more votes than the others is chosen.

> **No Really, it's a tie**: Flip a coin, roll a die, use a Pseudo-Random Number Generator

## Example Game Play (Turkey)

### Setup
- 5 citizens were randomly placed in Turkey's 3 supply centers.

###  Alice, Bob and Chuck  nominate themselves as diplomats.
- Voting for the diplomats happened as follows:

| Voter | Preferences       |
|-------|-------------------|
| Alice | Alice, Bob        |
| Bob   | Bob, Chuck        |
| Chuck | Chuck, Alice      | 
| Dan   | Chuck, Bob        |
| Eve   | Alice, Chuck, Bob |

- Alice didn't get 50% of the votes, therefore Chuck is eliminated, and Dan's second choice goes to Bob and Chuck's second choice goes to Alice.
- Alice now has over 50% of the votes and is the diplomat.

### Citizens communicate with each other, Alice communicates with the other countries.
- Three sets of orders are proposed as follows:

**Set 1**
```
A CON-BUL
A SMY-CON
F ANK-BLA
```   

**Set 2**
```
A CON-BUL
A SMY-ARM
F ANK-BLA
```   


**Set 3**
```
A CON-BUL
A SMY HOLD
F ANK-CON
```   

- Voting for the orders happened as follows:

| Voter | Preferences |
|-------|-------------|
| Alice | 1,3         |
| Bob   | 3,1,2       |
| Chuck | 2,1,3       | 
| Dan   | 2,1,3       |
| Eve   | 1           |

- As Set 3 is eliminated, Bob's second preference goes to 1. 
- Orders 1 are sent to the Judge
